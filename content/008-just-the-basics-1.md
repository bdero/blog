Summary: During the precious little time I had to work on anything this week, this is what I could come up with. It's the start of something that I'd like to continue taking more time to work on. I want it to be a <a href="http://maxgames.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vectorzone/" title="GridWars source code" target="_blank">GridWars</a>-like game for browser use, but reserve the freedom to make implementation changes whenever I feel things could be more fun.

The source code is available on <a title="Just the Basics v0.1 source code" href="https://github.com/bdero/just-the-basics/tree/v0.1" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

To begin controlling it, click on the canvas. Moving around can be done with either the classic W, S, A, and D keys, or the arrow keys.

Currently, there's nothing you can do except simply move around, bumping into the walls and watching the stars float along with the world in a parallax. In v0.2, there should be a way to shoot bullets (maybe using pointer lock controls?) and something to destroy.

Stay tuned!
